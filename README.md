Hello, this is an attempt to give any user as a new entry to the Red language
something to read as an example, while giving something that can become useful later on.
It was done with Red version 0.6.0 May build on a GNU/Linux platform.

Feel free to clone this repository, test, learn and teach (there are no masters in this world, only students)

Happy coding,
AresAndy
